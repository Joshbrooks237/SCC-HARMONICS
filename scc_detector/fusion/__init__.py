Multi-Modal Fusion and ML Integration Module
=============================================

THE JURY. THE VERDICT.

All witnesses have testified. All evidence has been gathered.
Now the fusion engine weighs each modality, considers each feature,
and renders a judgment.

"One witness may lie. Four witnesses, speaking different languages,
 observing from different vantage points - their agreement is TRUTH."
