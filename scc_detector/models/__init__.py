"""
Deep Learning Models for SCC Detection
======================================

The machine learns what we teach it.
Neural networks, gradient boosting, ensemble methods -
these are the new surgical assistants.

"The algorithm sees patterns we cannot.
 But it is WE who must interpret.
 WE who must act.
 WE who bear responsibility."
